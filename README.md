======================

Solver for the game http://gameaboutsquares.com/ in F#

Depending mainly on the level size and number of squares, can solve 13-18 step long levels in reasonable time (less than a hour) and space (few gigs of RAM).
Planning to fix multithreading and decrease memory usage to make it perform better.

All levels 1-35 are entered but not all have been double checked and tested.
